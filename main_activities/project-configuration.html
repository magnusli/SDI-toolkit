    <h2>Project Configuration</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
          Project configuration refers the scope, mandate, objectives, and structure of the design and innovation project.
          The activity of configuring the project should be revisited continuously throughout the design process as
          the problem is better understood and formulated and as a solution gradually materializes. Initially,
          the project configuration can be guided by an initial and preliminary problem area of focus such as improving
          the usability of a data entry screen, or better supporting the use of routine data by a user group. Based on this,
          the initial scope, mandate, process and structure, and stakeholders are defined. As a better understanding of the
          problem and potential solutions develop these may be renegotiated and reformulated.
        </p>
        <h4>Key things to define as part of the project configuration:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Initial and preliminary problem area</li>
          <li>Project scope and mandate</li>
          <li>Values and objectives</li>
          <li>Process and structure</li>
          <li>Key stakeholders</li>
          <li>Resources</li>
          <li>Plan for how to engage key stakeholders</li>
          <li>Participants and roles for the (interdisciplinary) design team (including e.g., key stakeholders, designers, developers, end-user representative(s), client project managers)</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Defining the project's design scope</h3>
      <p>
        When configuring a project, it is valuable to explicitly define the potential design scope of the project in
        terms of what can be subject to change and with what means. The scope will greatly affect the “design space”
        one have in terms of the appropriate means available to address the problem of focus. The scope will hence
        influence how broad of a problem that is relevant to address in the project, and the solutions that are realistic to
        explore through ideation, prototyping and evaluation.
        <br><br>
        Defining the scope of design  involves asking the question; <i>what is up for design?</i>
        <br><br>
        Is design limited to the user interfaces of
        a tool? The full form and function of a single or multiple tools? Or the larger socio-technical system of the
        organization including aspects such as roles, work routines, policies, and data reporting standards?
      </p>

      <h4>Potential design scope for a socio-technical design and innovation project may be limited to or include:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The user interfaces of a tool</li>
        <li>The full form and function of a tool or set of tools (e.g., an app)</li>
        <li>Aspects of the social system such as roles, work routines, policies, and standards</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        First, the scope may be limited to designing and innovating on a digital artifact,
        either limited to its user interface or to the entire tool or a set of tools. For instance, the scope of a project
        may be to strengthen data quality by improving the user interface of a data entry application. Alternatively, the
        scope may be broader to include designing and innovating on an existing tool with improved functionality, or to
        invent a new tool such as an application. In the later case, the scope of design includes not only the user interface
        of the tool but also its purpose and function.
        <br><br>
        In socio-technical design, the scope may, as the name suggests, go beyond design of tools and user interfaces
        to encompass the design of the social system in which the tools are a part of. For instance, work routines,
        policies, data reporting standards, and roles may be subject to design and change. Figure 1 illustrates three
        different types of scope in socio-technical design and innovation projects. The lower two can be seen as
        designing tools and user interfaces for a socio-technical system, and the latter as design of a socio-technical
        system, including both technology and the social system such as work practices, policy, and roles.

    <section>
      <h4>Scope is dependent on project mandate</h4>
      <p>
        A larger project scope allows for exploring a vider set of potential solutions to a problematic situation,
        and for the design and innovation of more radical changes to the organization. However, a larger scope also
        requires a larger project mandate and, potentially, greater resources and competence to explore, assess, and
        design non-technical interventions such as organizational change interventions.
