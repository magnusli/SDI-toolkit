    <h2>Project Configuration</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
          Project configuration refers the scope, mandate, objectives, and structure of the design and innovation project.
          The activity of configuring the project should be revisited continuously throughout the design process as
          the problem is better understood and formulated and as a solution gradually materializes. Initially,
          the project configuration can be guided by an initial and preliminary problem area of focus such as improving
          the usability of a data entry screen, or better supporting the use of routine data by a user group. Based on this,
          the initial scope, mandate, process and structure, and stakeholders are defined. As a better understanding of the
          problem and potential solutions develop these may be renegotiated and reformulated.
        </p>
        <h4>Key things to define as part of the project configuration:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Initial and preliminary problem area</li>
          <li>Project scope and mandate</li>
          <li>Values and objectives</li>
          <li>Process and structure</li>
          <li>Key stakeholders</li>
          <li>Resources</li>
          <li>Plan for how to engage key stakeholders</li>
          <li>Participants and roles for the (interdisciplinary) design team (including e.g., key stakeholders, designers, developers, end-user representative(s), client project managers)</li>
