    <h2>Project Configuration</h2>

    <p>
      Project configuration refers the scope, mandate, objectives, and structure of the design and innovation project.
      The activity of configuring the project should be revisited continuously throughout the design process as
      the problem is better understood and formulated and as a solution gradually materializes. Initially,
      the project configuration can be guided by an initial and preliminary problem area of focus such as improving
      the usability of a data entry screen, or better supporting the use of routine data by a user group. Based on this,
      the initial scope, mandate, process and structure, and stakeholders are defined. As a better understanding of the
      problem and potential solutions develop these may be renegotiated and reformulated.
    </p>
    <h4>Key things to define as part of the project configuration:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Initial and preliminary problem area</li>
      <li>Project scope and mandate</li>
      <li>Values and objectives</li>
      <li>Process and structure</li>
      <li>Key stakeholders</li>
      <li>Resources</li>
      <li>Plan for how to engage key stakeholders</li>
      <li>Participants and roles for the (interdisciplinary) design team (including e.g., key stakeholders, designers, developers, end-user representative(s), client project managers)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Defining the project's design scope and mandate</h3>
    <p>
      When configuring a project, it is valuable to explicitly define the potential design scope of the project in
      terms of what can be subject to change and with what means. The scope will greatly affect the “design space”
      one have in terms of the appropriate means available to address the problem of focus. The scope will hence
      influence how broad of a problem that is relevant to address in the project, and the solutions that are realistic to
      explore through ideation, prototyping and evaluation.
      <br><br>
      Defining the scope of design  involves asking the question; <i>what is up for design?</i>
      <br><br>
      Is design limited to the user interfaces of
      a tool? The full form and function of a single or multiple tools? Or the larger socio-technical system of the
      organization including aspects such as roles, work routines, policies, and data reporting standards?
    </p>

    <h4>Potential design scope for a socio-technical design and innovation project may be limited to or include:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The user interfaces of a tool</li>
      <li>The full form and function of a tool or set of tools (e.g., an app)</li>
      <li>Aspects of the social system such as roles, work routines, policies, and standards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      First, the scope may be limited to designing and innovating on a digital artifact,
      either limited to its user interface or to the entire tool or a set of tools. For instance, the scope of a project
      may be to strengthen data quality by improving the user interface of a data entry application. Alternatively, the
      scope may be broader to include designing and innovating on an existing tool with improved functionality, or to
      invent a new tool such as an application. In the later case, the scope of design includes not only the user interface
      of the tool but also its purpose and function.
      <br><br>
      In socio-technical design, the scope may, as the name suggests, go beyond design of tools and user interfaces
      to encompass the design of the social system in which the tools are a part of. For instance, work routines,
      policies, data reporting standards, and roles may be subject to design and change. Figure 1 illustrates three
      different types of scope in socio-technical design and innovation projects. The lower two can be seen as
      designing tools and user interfaces for a socio-technical system, and the latter as design of a socio-technical
      system, including both technology and the social system such as work practices, policy, and roles.

    <h4>Scope is dependent on project mandate</h4>
    <p>
      A larger project scope allows for exploring a vider set of potential solutions to a problematic situation,
      and for the design and innovation of more radical changes to the organization. However, a larger scope also
      requires a larger project mandate and, potentially, greater resources and competence to explore, assess, and
      design non-technical interventions such as organizational change interventions.
    </p>


    <h3>Defining the project's objectives and values</h3>
    <p>
      Any IT or organizational change project is driven by some more or less explicit objectives and values.
      It is useful to explicitly reflect, discuss, and define these (and frequently revisit them as part of reconfiguring the project)
      as different objectives and values will have significant implications for the design and innovation process
      and its outcomes.
    </p>
    <h4>Primary objectives</h4>
      <p>
      First and foremost, the primary objectives of the projects should be defined, which should capture the main intended
      outcome of the project. For instance, a primary objective could be to increase the use of data in decision making,
      to improve data quality, strenghten the working conditions of a group workers, or to strengthen the usability of a data entry tool.
    </p>
    <h4>Secondary objectives and values</h4>
    <p>
      Projects often also involve a variety of changes beyond the primary objectives that affects various stakeholders.
      Secondary objectives can be designed related to other positive outcomes one seeks to achieve or commits to through
      the project. For instance, a project can be based on participatory values to ensure a democratic design process, or
      that the project should commit to humanistic values that promotes the welfare of workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The list below offers some common objectives and values and corresbonding principles that may help define the
      primary and secondary for the project. For each, a set of relevant principles from different approaches to
      socio-technical design are provided.
    </p>
    <h4>Potentially relevant principles for the design project</h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="collapsible">Participatory principles for design projects</li>
      <section class="content">
        <p>
          Participatory design involves the commitment to a democratic design process, and potentially, to
          help develop the democratic practices of the organization in general. A key concern if commiting to
          participatory design principles is thus <i>Who is involved in what decisions and in what way</i>.
          <br><br>
          <i>Real</i> participation in key decisions of the design project from all levels of the organization
          should be emphasized, securing that all affected by the implementation of new technologies and social
          arrangements have a say. Particularly, user groups that are directly impacted (e.g., primary end-users of a tool)
          such as health workers, health managers, and data entry clerks which may tend to be less part of key decisions
          should be given a voice and a real opportunity to affect what problems are addressed, what solutions are introduced,
          and how these are designed and implemented. <br><br>
          Participatory design thus goes far beyond involving users in late evaluations of
          the usability of user interfaces, to involving affected stakeholders throughout the project, from problem
          formulation to solution discovery, to designing the details of the solution.
        </p>
        <h4>Some key principles for a participatory design project:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Genuine user participation</li>
          <li>Deep commitments to democracy and democratisation</li>
          <li>Increasing workplace democracy</li>
          <li>Actual co-determination (e.g., by unions and management)</li>
          <li>Mutual learning and capacitating participants to secure meaningful involvement in decisions</li>
        </ul>

          The tradition of <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-social-design-of-technical-systems-building-technologies-for-communities/socio-technical-design">
          socio-technical design</a> is based on humanistic values that emphasize workers well-being.
          The rationale is to secure that design projects emphasize developing meaningful workpaces for those affected
          by the project. An example could be a project focusing on improving the capture of routine health data from
          health facilities, which, following humanistic principles, emphasize the well-being of the health workers that
          are to use implemented tools and routines. As evident in the set of principles outlined below "Well-being" goes
          far beyond usability metrics such as "ease of use" of user interfaces, to include reasonably demanding jobs that
          is percived as meaningful, and opportunities for self-development towards a desirable future.
        </p>
        <h4>Some key principles for a humanistic design project:</h4>
        <p>The design project should seek to secure that....</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Jobs to be reasonably demanding</li>
            <li>Workers should have the opportunity to learn and build their (desirable) skills</li>
            <li>Workers should have an area of decision-making</li>
            <li>Workers should have social support</li>
            <li>Workers should have the opportunity to relate work to social life</li>
            <li>Workers should have a job that leads to a desirable future</li>
