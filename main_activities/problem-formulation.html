    <h2>Problem formulation</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
          Problem formulation is about defining the problem to be addressed in the design and innovation project.
          Many design and innovation projects suffer from being guided by a superficial or implicit understanding
          of the problem to be solved, and the lack of a critical examination of what represents the right problem
          to solve. This may result in building solutions or interventions that are irrelevant or the missing out
          of opportunities for innovations that results in more valuable improvements to the organization (REF).
          Accordingly, problem formulation should be an explicit activity which is revisited several times based
          on the developing appreciation of the problem situation. <br><br> In a project, one should thus iterate several
          times between problem formulation and developing an understanding of the socio-technical system to ensure
          to develop a sufficiently detailed understanding of the “right” problem to be addressed before moving to
          identifying potential solutions. The larger, more multi-faceted, more complex, and vaguely defined the
          problem is, the more iterations would be required before moving towards exploring and identifying possible
          solutions. A reformulating the problem may also require iterations back to the project configuration to
          redefine the design scope and mandate of the project.

        <h3>Define and explore the problem hierarchy</h3>
        <p>
          Problems are most often nested and recursive. That is, a problem is often part of a broader and more
          fundamental problem, and vice versa, a problem often comprise of several problems. An important part of
          problem formulation is to identify the hierarchy of problems and decide what level the project should be
          organized around. This can be developed by answering two questions, which may involve iterating between
          problem formulation and developing an understanding of the socio-technical system:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Why is it a problem?</li>
            <li>What causes the problem?</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          Answering these questions may involve several iterations between problem formulation and developing an
          understanding of the existing socio-technical system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Figure 1 offers an example of a problem hierarchy. Surrounded by stippled lines is the preliminary
          problem formulation. By asking the question How is this a problem?, several levels (and two alternative “routes”)
          of antecedent problems have been identified. Further, by exploring the question what is the cause of the problem?
          through the activity of developing an understanding of the existing socio-technical system, we have identified three
          descendent problems. These three may in turn have several levels of descendent problem.

        <h4>Moving upwards the problem hierarchy</h4>
        <p>
          Note that for every of the antecedent problems in the hierarchy shown in Figure X it is possible to develop a tree of multiple descendent problems. For example, if exploring the descendents to the problem “the routine health data is unreliable”, one may identify many other than “data quality is low”, such as, “reporting rates are low” and “the denominators used for calculating indicators are wrong”. As another example, the problem “Health management decisions are based too little on data” may, beyond “the routine data is unreliable” have descendent problems such as “there is a lack of tools that presents relevant data in an effective manner” or “there is a lack of work routines related to routine data use”. Defining a problem hierarchy thus helps in examining if and why a problem matters, and if it makes more sense to organize the project around a broader antecedent problem. Accordingly, by exploring the problem hierarchy, one may decide to jump one or several levels up to antecedent problems to explore alternative descendents.
          <br><br>
          Deciding to redefine the problem to an antecedent problem will increase the design and innovation space of the project and increase the probability of addressing the “right” problem. “Right” being the problem which, when solved, would have the greatest positive effect on the antecedent problems that really matter. For instance, rather than defining the problem of focus in the project as “the usability of the data entry screen is poor”, one may redefine it to “routine data is unreliable”, which, in turn, will open up for exploring a wider range of potential descendant problems and possible solutions. However, broadening the problem formulation will also affect the scope of the project, and is dependent on its mandate. The problem formulation must hence be realistic given the project mandate, or require a reformulation of the scope and mandate if possible.

        <h4>Moving downwards the problem hierarchy</h4>
        <p>
          Similarly, by developing an understanding of the existing socio-technical system, one will identify several
          descendent problems that make part of causing the problem for focus. It is useful to systematically document these
          problems and decide whether the project will address one of these, or several. In the example in Figure 1, the
          project could thus involve addressing all three descendent problems, or it could be reframed to focus on one, such
          as the problem of “users selecting the wrong reporting form”. If doing the latter, it is necessary to further develop
          the understanding of the existing socio-technical system to define the tree of descendents to form basis for identifying
          the right solution(s).

        <h3>Secure early and continuous stakeholder involvement and commitment</h3>
        <p>
          Problems are always formulated from a perspective, and what is considered to be a problem by one stakeholder
          may not be so by another. To secure commitment from key stakeholders, these should accordingly be involved in
          the problem formulation activities to make sure that everyone agrees that the problem is relevant to be addressed,
          and as a consequence, are committed to exploring and potentially implementing relevant solutions.
