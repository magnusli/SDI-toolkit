          Develop understanding involves active inquiries to collect and analyze insights to
          develop a sufficiently detailed understanding of relevant aspects of the existing socio-technical system and the
          problematic situation that is to be addressed such as existing work practices, roles, norms, tools, challenges, and actors.
          <br><br>
          The activity is typically re-visited several times throughout the project. Initially, the aim will often
          be to carry out a detailed diagnosis of the defined problem area to better understand what the problem is
          comprised of (i.e., what are the descendant problems). These insights will feed into further problem formulation.
          Consecutive revisits to the activity may be triggered when realizing insufficient knowledge about some aspect of
          the problem situation, be it the use of a specific tool or the practices of a group of users.

      <h3 class="collapsible">Defining learning goals</h3>
      <section class="content">
        <p>
          Defining a set of learning goals helps plan and guide the process of collection and analysis of insights,
          and defining them should be guided by the question what do we need to know to understand the problem and to
          discover and create a solution?. Each learning goal should thus point to concrete aspects of the existing socio-technical
          system that is relevant to understand the problem, and for identifying solutions. What is relevant to understand depends
          on the scope and mandate of the project, and should hence be reflected in the learning goals. For instance, if the
          scope of the project relates to improving usability of a user interface, learning goals should be directed at
          understanding current work practices and challenges for end-users using the user interface. If the problem is a
          larger organizational issue, learning goals may involve understanding the broader work practices, data flow, tools,
          needs, roles, and pertinent challenges of a larger part of the organization.
          <br><br>
          For each learning goal, appropriate ways to collect, analyze, and document insights should be defined.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h3 class="collapsible">Collecting, analyzing, and documenting insights</h3>
      <section class="content">
        <p>
          Based on the learning goals, the design team should address these by collecting data. This could,
          depending on the scope of the project, include conducting interviews, observation, analysing documents
          such as existing reporting forms, and examining existing tools.
          <br><br>
          As data is collected, it is continuously analyzed to explicitly answer the learning goals. For instance,
          through interviews, lists of pertinent challenges for different stakeholders, diagrams of workflows, the
          flow of data, and mapping of existing tools may be developed.
          <br><br>
          Key elements should be documented to be used as basis for problem formulation and ideation in
          formats such as user stories, personas, scenarios, workflow diagrams, data flow diagrams. These
          are also important for discussing key findings internally in the design team and with other stakeholders
          to reformulate the problem and, potentially, the project scope and mandate.
