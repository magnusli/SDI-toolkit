    <h2>Ideation</h2>
      <p>
        Ideation involves systematic efforts to generate ideas for the design of a solution.
        In many projects, ideation is an implicit activity where designers, developers, and user organizations quickly
        jump to a solution without sufficient exploration of an assessment of different alternatives. This is not ideal, as
        the idea that first comes to mind is not always the best. Good solutions often come out of a systematic and disciplined
        effort of exploring different ideas and hence, in approaches such as design thinking, ideation is made an explicit stage
        of the process.
        <br><br>
        In early phases of a project, ideation will revolve around
        generating and assessing ideas for the overall solution on a conceptual level. As the design process progress and the project has commited to an
        overall conceptual idea, ideation will involve generating ideas for various more spesific dimensions of the solution, such as the specific functionalies
        of an app, or the layout of a user interface.
        <br><br>
        A sufficiently detailed understanding of the existing of the problem situation and the surrounding socio-technical system is essential as a basis for well-informed ideation.

      <h4>Three suggested steps of ideation</h4>
      <ol class="steps_list">
        <li>Generate several candidate ideas for solutions</li>
        <li>Discuss to assess the merit of the different ideas based on their realism and utility</li>
        <li>Iterate between ideation, prototyping, and evaluation with the ideas with the most merit until the most appropriate solution is identified</li>
      </ol>

    <h3 class="collapsible"><i class="fa-solid fa-angles-down"></i>Things to think about when ideating</h3>
    <section class="content">
      <h4 id="discovery_creation">Ideation for solution discovery or solution creation</h4>
        <p>
          The SDI process involves both discovery - identifying the right solution, and creation - identifying how to best design the specific features of that solution. Both of these phases will involve ideation,
          prototyping and evaluation. Ideation in the discovery phase will typically be more conceptual - generating ideas for the overall concept of a solution. Should it be a change in a user interface?
          Improvements to a tool? A new tool? A change in a work routine or a role? All of these? These conceptual ideas can be prototyped using appropriate techniques for evaluating conceptual prototypes
          (see the prototyping activity). For the creation phase, ideation is about exploring the specific features and dimensions of the decided solution. This could include the form and function of the
          functionality of a tool, user interface features, or the details of how a service, work routine, or work role is to be organized. Different dimensions are prototyped and evaluated with relevant techniques.
        </p>

      <h4 id="convergent_divergent">Convergent versus divergent thinking</h4>
              <p>
                Ideation can be organized emphasizing divergent thinking or convergent thinking. Early ideation benefits from generating a large number of ideas. Divergent thinking involves taking a
                wide perspective with the aim of generating a broad range of ideas. Divergent thinking is thus particularly relevant early in the discovery phase, but may also be used in early ideation
                for dimensions in the creation phase. Table X offers an overview of some ideation techniques that are suitable for divergent thinking.
                Later ideation must involve convergent thinking, where the team attempts to narrow down possible opportunities by critically assessing their merit.
              </p>

        <h4>Ideating socio-technical solutions</h4>
              <p>
                IT-people tend to think in terms of apps and software features. However, as elaborated under the project configuration activity, socio-technical design may be organized with a scope and mandate that allows for solutions beyond technology, for instance including changes to work routines, roles, and standards. Very often, problems can be solved by focusing on changes to the social system, and hence, should be subject to attention in the early ideation activities. Accordingly, ideation in the discovery phase should include people with competence and background beyond IT, and important questions to support ideation could revolve around current strengths and weaknesses in the social aspects of the organization, and how social changes may make improvements.
              </p>

        <h4>Addition versus subtraction</h4>
              <p>
                Interestingly, humans are inclined to attempt to solve problems by adding something new, be it a new functionality to an app, or a new routine or standard to organizational processes
                (<a href="https://hbr.org/2022/02/when-subtraction-adds-value">reference</a>).
                Often, however, the best solution may as well be to subtract something. A design and innovation project can be as much about removing redundant, low-value features from technology and
                organizational practice as to add new ones. At least, it is important to remember that if the design project are on course to add some new tool or routine, it would be wise to critically
                assess what could be subtracted as part of the process to avoid the accumulation of additional workload and organizational complexity. As human often immediately think in terms of addition when
                ideating, it is thus valuable to explicitly make questions around what could be subtracted part of ideation activities.

              </ul>

        <h4>Realistic ideation with basis in a software design infrastructure such as DHIS2</h4>
          <p>A key part of any realistic organizational improvement project involving IT is to limit immediate and long-term costs of developing and sustaining the IT solution(s). Where as ideation
            with divergent thinking can be open-ended and initially involve more or less realistic ideas, during convergent thinking it is important to consider the potential immediate and
            long-term cost of potential solutions. As IT solutions potentially will involve large investments in development work and in maintaining them over time, how to secure realistic IT
            solutions are particularly important.
            <br><br>
            Very often, SDI-projects thus relies on generic software solutions as DHIS2 which offers a <i>design infrastructure</i> of more or less ready-made features which are sustained over time.
            A central part of realistic ideation is thus to consider what is readily supported by generic software features and how could these be leveraged to build low-cost technical solutions.
            If it is difficult to find ways to use generic software features for the planned solution, a cost-benefit analysis concerning flexibility vs sustainability must be made - i.e., does the technical solution
            have to be exactly this or could we use a generic resources and rather supplement with some interventions to the social system around it (e.g., to the routines or trainings)?
            Or does the benefit of a custom solution outweight the costs of sustaining it over time?
            <br><br>
            As part of ideation one may also browse the DHIS2 app hub to see if there are any third-party extensions that may be relevant, or the DHIS2 community of practice to see if others have experience
            with addressing similar challenges.
