    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        Evaluation is about subjecting prototypes to feedback and testing with relevant stakeholders such as
        project managers and end-users. The findings from the evaluation feeds into new cycles of ideation and
        prototyping, or, eventually, to establishing that the design is satisfactory for implementation.
        Evaluation may hence result in findings that show that the prototyped dimension is the wrong way to go,
        that it needs refinement on certain aspects, or that it is satisfactory.
        <br><br>
        Evaluation is tightly integrated with prototyping as one selects the form of prototyping based on the
        dimensions of a solution one wants to evaluate. This means that the form of evaluation should be decided
        in tandem with deciding what dimensions to prototype and how to prototype them.
        <br><br>
        Different types of dimensions and prototypes invites for different types of evaluations. Low-fidelity
        prototypes often invite for and require more open-ended forms of evaluations such as discussions, demonstrations,
        and walkthroughs. High-fidelity prototypes, which, for instance, can be used to evaluate usability, invite for
        more realistic evaluations where the user actually use a user interface or an app.
