    <h2>Prototyping</h2>
      <p>
        Prototyping involves developing artifact(s) that help in exploring one or several dimensions of a potential
        solution and is used to communicate, discuss, and evaluate ideas and concrete solutions within the design
        team and with other stakeholders. The form and content of a prototype is thus developed based on what is to be
        communicated, evaluated and discussed and helps in concretizing ideas.
      </p>

      <h3>Low and high-fidelity prototypes</h3>
      <p>
        Prototypes may range from low-fidelity to high-fidelity depending on how close the prototype is to a working solution.
        To make prototyping efficient, one should seek to use the least time consuming and resource-intensive form of prototyping
        which effectively can be used to explore the relevant dimension. For instance, if exploring the appropriate size of a physical
        device to be worn by a health worker out in the field, it is more efficient to use pieces of wood with different sizes and
        weights and evaluate these than to build a fully functioning digital device and later find out that it is too large or heavy.
        Similarly, if exploring the rough concept around a web-based app, it is often preferable to develop a set of conceptual
        sketches rather than implementing a fully functioning app to find out it represents a bad solution to the problem.
        <br><br>
        Also, some dimensions of a solution may be better evaluated in a naturalistic setting (in situations close to or similar to a
        real situation) or in a controlled environment (e.g., a lab, a workshop, in a meeting).
      </p>

      <h3>Evolutionary prototyping</h3>
      <p>
        Prototypes of various kinds should be used throughout the design process beginning with prototypes for
        discovering the right solution to build or the right intervention (conceptual) and gradually moving to
        prototypes for exploring how to build the solution right (e.g., exploring details of functionalities,
        workflows, user interfaces). Prototyping is thus an evolutionary process where the prototype evolves with
        the project from initial ideas to a working solution.
