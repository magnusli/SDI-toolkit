        <h3>What is ideation?</h3>
          <p>
            Ideation involves systematic efforts to generate ideas for a) what is the right solution, and later in the process, b) how to design the specific features of that solution. A sufficiently detailed understanding of the existing socio-technical system that make part of the problematic situation is essential as a basis for well-informed ideation. In many projects, ideation is an implicit activity where designers, developers, and user organizations quickly jump to a solution without sufficient exploration of an assessment of different alternatives. This is not ideal, as the idea that first comes to mind is not always the best. Good solutions often come out of a systematic and disciplined effort of exploring different ideas and hence, in approaches such as design thinking, ideation is made an explicit stage of the process.

            <p>
              The SDI process involves both discovery - identifying the right solution, and creation - identifying how to best design the specific features of that solution. Both of these phases will involve ideation, prototyping and evaluation. Ideation in the discovery phase will typically be more conceptual - generating ideas for the overall concept of a solution. Should it be a change in a user interface? Improvements to a tool? A new tool? A change in a work routine or a role? All of these? These conceptual ideas can be prototyped using appropriate techniques for evaluating conceptual prototypes (see the prototyping activity). For the creation phase, ideation is about exploring the specific features and dimensions of the decided solution. This could include the form and function of the functionality of a tool, user interface features, or the details of how a service, work routine, or work role is to be organized. Different dimensions are prototyped and evaluated with relevant techniques.

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Ideation can be organized emphasizing divergent thinking or convergent thinking. Early ideation benefits from generating a large number of ideas. Divergent thinking involves taking a wide perspective with the aim of generating a broad range of ideas. Divergent thinking is thus particularly relevant early in the discovery phase, but may also be used in early ideation for dimensions in the creation phase. Table X offers an overview of some ideation techniques that are suitable for divergent thinking.
              Later ideation must involve convergent thinking, where the team attempts to narrow down possible opportunities by critically assessing their merit.
              It is optimal to alternate between divergence and convergence as this allows us to discover a wider range of new problems and opportunities, but also narrow them down. If the problem selected are not good enough, we can always have a broader divergent view again.

            <p>
              IT-people tend to think in terms of apps and software features. However, as elaborated under the project configuration activity, socio-technical design may be organized with a scope and mandate that allows for solutions beyond technology, for instance including changes to work routines, roles, and standards. Very often, problems can be solved by focusing on changes to the social system, and hence, should be subject to attention in the early ideation activities. Accordingly, ideation in the discovery phase should include people with competence and background beyond IT, and important questions to support ideation could revolve around current strengths and weaknesses in the social aspects of the organization, and how social changes may make improvements.

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Interestingly, humans are inclined to attempt to solve problems by adding something new, be it a new functionality to an app, or a new routine or standard to organizational processes (REF). Often, however, the best solution may as well be to subtract something. A design and innovation project can be as much about removing redundant, low-value features from technology and organizational practice as to add new ones. At least, it is important to remember that if the design project are on course to add some new tool or routine, it would be wise to critically assess what could be subtracted as part of the process to avoid the accumulation of additional workload and organizational complexity. As human often immediately think in terms of addition when ideating, it is thus valuable to explicitly make questions around what could be subtracted part of ideation activities.
